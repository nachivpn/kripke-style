# Modal Natural Deduction

A small overview on how natural deduction systems (of some flavour) can be used as proof systems for normal modal logics.

## Motivation 

Recall the necessitation rule in axiomatic derivation systems such in Hilbert-type derivation systems:
```
    A
---------NEC
   □ A

```
In natural deduction systems such an inference rule is not longer sound since in the semantics necessitation only holds at the model level (in contrast to a particular world): 
`M ⊩ A ⇒ M ⊩ □ A`

In this (small) presentation I will explore some ways on how necessitation can be expressed in natural deduction systems.
Details to be figured out...
