This is a short note containing proof of completeness of intuitionistic propositional logic (IPL) for its Kripke semantics.

Fix some set 𝓥 of propositional variables. A *Kripke frame* is a preordered set (W,≤) and a *Kripke Model* is a frame plus a valuation
: V : 𝓥 × W → {0,1}
which is monotone in the W-argument.

The interpretation of formulas is given by
: ⟦p⟧(w) = V(p,w)
: ⟦A ∧ B⟧(w) = ⟦A⟧(w) ∧ ⟦B⟧(w)
: ⟦A → B⟧(w) = ∀w'. w ≤ w' ⇒ ⟦A⟧(w') ⇒ ⟦B⟧(w')
: ⟦A ∨ B⟧(w) = ⟦A⟧(w) ∨ ⟦B⟧(w)
: ⟦⊥⟧(w) = 0

The {∧,→}-fragment of IPL is given by the following deduction system.

: A ∈ Γ
: --
: Γ ⊢ A

: Γ ⊢ A, Γ ⊢ B
: ==
: Γ ⊢ A ∧ B

: Γ,A ⊢ B
: --
: Γ ⊢ A → B

: Γ ⊢ A → B, Γ ⊢ A
: --
: Γ ⊢ B

*Theorem*: {∧,→}-IPL is complete for its Kripke semantics.
*Proof*: Construct a universal Kripke model as follows. A world is a deductively closed set of formulas (we don't need to worry about consistent in this fragment). The accessibility relation is just set inclusion. The valuation is
: V(p,w) = [p ∈ w].

*Lemma*: ⟦A⟧(w) = [A ∈ w].
*Proof*: By induction on A, for all worlds w. The case A = p ∈ 𝓥 is obvious. For A ∧ B,
: ⟦A ∧ B⟧(w) = ⟦A⟧(w) ∧ ⟦B⟧(w) = [A ∈ w] ∧ [B ∈ w] = [A ∧ B ∈ w].
For A → B, suppose A → B ∈ w, and suppose w ≤ w' and ⟦A⟧(w'). Then A ∈ w' and A → B ∈ w ⊆ w', so B ∈ w', so ⟦B⟧(w'), as required. Conversely, suppose ⟦A → B⟧(w). Let w' be the deductive closure of w ∪ {A}. Then w ≤ w' and A ∈ w', so ⟦A⟧(w'), so ⟦B⟧(w'), so B ∈ w', so w,A ⊢ B. It follows that w ⊢ A → B, so A → B ∈ w. ∎Lemma

Now, suppose A is a formula valid in all Kripke models. Writing T for the set of intuitionistic tautologies in the {∧,→}-fragment, we have ⟦A⟧(T). So by the lemma A ∈ T.
∎Theorem

*Remark*: We could have taken our worlds to just be contexts, and prove a lemma ⟦A⟧(Γ) = [Γ ⊢ A].

*Theorem*: Full IPL is complete for its Kripke semantics.
*Proof*: Construct a universal Kripke model as follows. A world is a set of formulas which is
1. deductively closed,
2. consistent,
3. disjunctively closed: whenever A ∨ B ∈ w then either A ∈ w or B ∈ w.

*Lemma*: Let S be a consistent set of formulas. Then there exists a world w containing S.
*Proof*: By Zorn's Lemma we can extend S to a *maximal* consistent set T. By the usual arguments, T is deductively closed. It remains to show that T is disjunctively closed. Suppose A ∨ B ∈ T. Then, if A,B ∉ T, this means both T ∪ {A} and T ∪ {B} are inconsistent. I.e., ¬A,¬B ∈ T. But A ∨ B, ¬A, ¬B ⊢ ⊥, so ⊥ ∈ T, a contradiction. ∎Lemma

We take the valuation to be
: V(p,w) = [p ∈ w].

*Lemma*: ⟦A⟧(w) = [A ∈ w].
*Proof*: By induction on A, for all worlds w. The cases p ∈ 𝓥 and A ∧ B are exactly as before. For A → B, the case [A → B ∈ w] ≤ ⟦A → B⟧(w) is the same. For the converse, suppose ⟦A → B⟧(w). If w ∪ {A} is inconsistent, it means ¬A ∈ w, from we have A → B ∈ w. If w ∪ {A} is consistent, we can use the lemma to find a world w' containing it, and then complete the proof as before.

The case ⊥ is trivial, since worlds are by definition consistent. Finally, we consider the case A ∨ B. But
: ⟦A ∨ B⟧(w) = ⟦A⟧(w) ∨ ⟦B⟧(w) = [A ∈ w] ∨ [B ∈ w] = [A ∨ B ∈ w]
by the disjunctive closure of w. ∎Lemma

Now, suppose A is a formula valid in all Kripke models. Writing T for the set of intuitionistic tautologies, T is a world since intuitionistic logic has 'the disjunction property' and is consistent. So ⟦A⟧(T). So by the lemma, A ∈ T.
